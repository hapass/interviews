    Less so: Groovy, Gradle, OCaml, Python, Javascript
    Preface:
        Playtika has in-house game engine that is written in C# and works for all platforms except web.
        They made a clone of their engine in Haxe, that runs on web in flash and html5 forms.
        Haxe team had even more wild concept, that they could compile Haxe to C# (compiler supports that), and run the compiled code with original game engine for all other platforms.
        They hired me to write a POC for that, and test the approach on one of their new projects.
    Done:
        * Implemented macros that adapted the interface of the C# engine, to Haxe version. First for test project, than for poker heat.
        * Implemented facebook login for mobile versions of Poker Heat.
        * Implemented images caching for mobile version.
        * Implemented networking for mobile version.
        * Integrated analytics in the game.
        * Integrated crash tracking.
        * Implemented payments for almost all platforms.
        * Fixed critical gameplay issues specific to mobile.
        * Implemented parts of build automation pipeline.
        * Integrated advertisement.
        * Implemented authentication system for Playtika's servers.
        * Debugged new version of haxe compiler when it was freezing during compilation of our game, and found a workaround.
        * Updated game engine for our game. Did temporary fixes for issues in new versions of the game engine and reported them back to the engine team.
        * Investigated and fixed spikes in ANRs and crashes on production.
        * Covered with tests, and stabilized the implementation of MegaBonus feature.
        * Reviewed code and got reviewed.
        * Optimized network performance of the game.
        * Fixed resource leak issues.
